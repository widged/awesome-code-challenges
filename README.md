    Hi – Seeing as you know this space so well I’d like to introduce you to our site [http://www.geektastic.com](http://www.geektastic.com) (just in case you haven’t heard of us yet).

    We are the only platform to use real world coding challenges that are peer reviewed by real humans.

    This gives us far more insight than automated platforms.

    Developers receive a thorough review (not just a score) and get to see the feedback from the reviewer (they can even feedback on the reviewers comments)

    I would love to show you round one day.
