# Awesome Code Challenges

[Analysts expect](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/tech-jobs-will-see-steady-growth-through-2023/) technology hiring to continue growing steadily into the 2020s. However, a problem we face in our field is the proliferation of new languages, frameworks, and technologies. Challenges and puzzles let us routinely become a better problem solver, learn the intricacies of a programming language, prepare for job interviews, learn new algorithms, and more.

## Genres

### (Algorithmic) Coding Challenges

> A coding challenge is a small or big coding task that is solved by an individual or a team in order to practice or measure the skills of the programmer. Itâ€™s used very often for hiring programmers and potential employes by companies.

> Challenges are short and they help you practice problem-solving, mathematics, and algorithms. They are great to prepare for the technical interviews and test that potential employers will face you with.
