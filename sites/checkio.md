### Community backed solution reviews

Users can publish their solutions for different problems and other users can review the code and give their opinions on how they would have solved the problem. Sometimes, some of the most active users get their code reviewed by Guido Van Rossum (the creator of the Python language) himself.

### Not for absolute beginners

CheckiO does not teach syntax, instead it teaches how to solve problems using a particular programming language therefore some basic programming knowledge is required to start. [See More](/topics/2497/viewpoints/1/~best-coding-challenge-sites~checkio#5)

### Available in multiple languages

CheckiO crowdsources translations for problems. Currently problems have been translated in 10 languages. So it's highly possible that eventually more languages will be supported. [See More](/topics/2497/viewpoints/1/~best-coding-challenge-sites~checkio#4)

### Ability to create new challenges

New missions can be created and uploaded using GitHub. After that is done, it's suggested to CheckiO and if it fills all the requirements after being reviewed by a CheckiO team member, it's pulled into the game. [See More](/topics/2497/viewpoints/1/~best-coding-challenge-sites~checkio#2)
