### Compare, and learn new tricks after the round

After your war, you will be able to see your code in comparison with your opponent's. If their solution was better than yours, you can learn from their code and next time adapt it into your code if you like it. It's a fantastic, fun way to learn among peers.

SophisticatedXiwangmu's Experience

I don't recommend codewars if you have some sort of "professional" approach. the whole site and concept is buggy and full of glitches and therefore it is time consuming and bit stressful (you won't receive the right amount of points, getting randomly logged out, slow, ...) what I miss most is to "brag" about your achievements. there is no public rank breakdown for the different languages. but if you just looking for a fun way to learn new concepts and train your skills it might be the right choice See More

Top Con

•••

### Sometimes buggy challenges

Often translated to another language, challenges have glitches and sometimes, correct solutions cannot pass tests. Challenge/translation approval process is too relaxed and stimulates quantity rather than quality. [See More](/topics/2497/viewpoints/9/~best-coding-challenge-sites~codewars#3)
