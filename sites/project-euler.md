Project Euler provides a large collection of challenges in the domain of computer science and mathematics. The challenges typically involve writing a small program to figure out the solution to a clever mathematical formula or equation, such as [finding the sum of digits](https://projecteuler.net/problem=551) of all numbers preceding each number in a series.

You cannot directly code on the website in an editor, so you would need to write a solution on your own computer and then provide the solution on their website.

**When it comes to math and computer sciences, probably the best source for coding challenges is ProjectEuler.** It focuses on the more advanced knowledge and you need to have certain mathematics knowledge, as well as some other skills.

Their challenges are based on writing a program to find the solution to tricky math problems or equations. It helps you with your creative thinking, learning and advancing in the programming language you’re using.

They offer weekly challenges, even though they don’t provide you with the online code editor. If you’re looking for the best place to advance your math knowledge with coding challenges in 2018, look no further.
