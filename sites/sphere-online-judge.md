**Sphere Online Judge or SPOJ for shorter is one of the biggest coding challenge libraries online.** It provides over 20,000 different coding challenges you can master with their online editor, but you can submit your code even if it was created in another editor rather than their own.

SPOJ hosts a lot of contents and sometimes even award gift cards and different prizes for the best coders. Their community is growing and it will probably grow more in 2018, so their discussion boards are great for learning. However, SPOJ doesnâ€™t offer official solutions or editorials on their challenges yet, but you can find solutions for almost every challenge on their discussion boards.
