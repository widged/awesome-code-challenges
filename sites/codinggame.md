## [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/start) – Beginner & Intermediate

**This website focuses on the beginner and intermediate level coders.** CodinGame differs from other websites from this list as you get to write the code in order to actually play a game online.

You get to complete challenges in order to complete a certain aspect of the game or to complete the entire game, and once you do that – you get to see the game with amazing graphics and UI.

The feeling of mastering some of the CodinGame challenges is very rewarding, and if you’re a beginner starting to learn about coding and programming, then this is the best place for you.
