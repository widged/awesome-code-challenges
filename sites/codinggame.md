**This website focuses on the beginner and intermediate level coders.** CodinGame differs from other websites from this list as you get to write the code in order to actually play a game online.

You get to complete challenges in order to complete a certain aspect of the game or to complete the entire game, and once you do that – you get to see the game with amazing graphics and UI.

The feeling of mastering some of the CodinGame challenges is very rewarding, and if you’re a beginner starting to learn about coding and programming, then this is the best place for you.

This website is different than the ones listed above because instead of simply solving coding challenges by producing a set of outputs, on CodinGame you write code to actually play a game online. It’s a great website and some of the games are very fun to watch once you’ve written your code (see [example](https://www.codingame.com/ide/980141293426648e9f31adb0881e1e01ae52d38)). The game graphics are nice and the editor/game UI is very smooth. Overall it’s a great website for beginners to learn coding.

CodinGame is a bit different from the other websites, because instead of simply solving coding challenges in an editor, you actually take part in writing the code for games that you play directly online. You can see a list of games currently offered [here](https://www.codingame.com/training) and an example of one [here](https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/there-is-no-spoon-episode-1). The game comes with a problem description, test cases, and an editor where you can write your code in one of 20+ programming languages.

Although this website is different than typical competitive programming websites such as the ones mentioned above, it is still [popular](https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/11/with-codingame-learning-to-code-becomes-a-game/) amongst programmers who enjoy solving challenges and taking part in contests.

### Consistently updated with new content

There are always new challenges, mini-games, and competitions to be found on the site. It would be a challenge in-itself to find yourself without anything to do. [See More](/topics/2497/viewpoints/11/~best-coding-challenge-sites~codingame#2)

### Primary focus is learning, education, and fun

Many of the other programming challenge websites focus on competition or job placement. Codingame, however, focuses on improving your skills through pure gamified education. [See More](/topics/2497/viewpoints/11/~best-coding-challenge-sites~codingame#1)
