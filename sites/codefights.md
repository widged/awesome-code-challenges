CodeFights provides a collection of coding challenges for you to solve in their online editor and there is a [forum](https://codefights.com/forum) for users to discuss the challenges. They also have a feature called [Company Bots](https://codefights.com/company-bots) where you write code to compete against a “bot” that was programed by engineers at companies like Uber, Dropbox, and Quora.
