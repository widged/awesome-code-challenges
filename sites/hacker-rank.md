**This website is meant for the more intermediate and advanced level coders.** It focuses on different subjects from computer sciences and you can complete a number of challenges from math, SQL, AI, algorithms, and functional programming.

The challenges can be finished online and there is a leaderboard for each challenge. HackerRank also provides you with editorials that help explain the challenges and how to approach them, and there is an amazing discussion board where you get to exchange your experiences with other coders.

HackerRank has a large collection of coding challenges tailored towards algorithms and data structures, along with interview prep material, a discussion board for each challenge, and a list of top user solutions. They have challenges for other topics as well like functional programming, AI, Shell, SQL, and more.

### Great for

HackerRank is great for intermediate-to-advanced programmers who have already picked up the basics of a language and are ready to solve more complicated problems. The challenges are written with mathematical notation and can sometimes be a little confusing, which is why it might not be so great for beginner developers.

### Pricing / Premium content

All the challenges on HackerRank are free, and there is no premium pricing option.
