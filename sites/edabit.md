([text from](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-8-most-popular-coding-challenge-websites-of-2020/))

This is the first time Edabit is appearing on our top sites list ([2018 list](https://medium.com/coderbyte/the-10-best-coding-challenge-websites-for-2018-12b57645b654), [2017 list](/news/the-10-most-popular-coding-challenge-websites-of-2016-fb8a5672d22f/))! It has grown in popularity over the last year, and developers seem to really enjoy the challenges. They offer a large collection of over 4,000 challenges that can be solved online in one of several languages.

The site currently only offers online interactive coding challenges — there aren’t any discussion boards, articles, user solutions, or mock interviews like other sites offer, but over time they might be adding some of these.

### Great for

Edabit is great for beginners looking to practice their coding skills daily by solving bite-sized challenges. Once you reach the intermediate stage, other sites provide harder challenges and more content geared towards competitive programming and job interviews.

### Pricing / Premium content

All the challenges on Edabit are free, and there is no premium pricing option.

### Bug

It's possible to submit an incorrect answer to a challenge, when user should have received a console error instead (with the button to complete the challenge greyed out). [See More](/topics/2497/viewpoints/13/~best-coding-challenge-sites~edabit#3)

### Get instant feedback

Users can start coding immediately while getting instant feedback. If their code works, they pass the challenge. If it doesn't, they fail and must try again. [See More](/topics/2497/viewpoints/13/~best-coding-challenge-sites~edabit#2)

DaringVulturnus's Experience

I was able to submit a completely incorrect solution, with no console/test errors to speak of. I submitted this issue/bug to the developer but have been all but ignored. See More

### Learn to think like a programmer

Almost everything relating to learning to code is geared toward only teaching basic syntax. Edabit goes beyond syntax and teaches its users how to think like real programmers (problem solving) in a fun and interactive way.
