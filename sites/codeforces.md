Codeforces is a Russian-based competitive programming [website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codeforces) that regularly hosts competitions where some of the [best](http://codeforces.com/profile/tourist) competitive programmers in the world compete online. If you’re a beginner coder, their challenges will most likely be too advanced for you — here are [some](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/908/C) [example](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/908/C)s of recent challenges. Their challenges usually require advanced math and algorithms knowledge.

Codeforces is now probably the top competitive programming website (a few years ago TopCoder was where most competitive programmers spent their time).

There are [problems](https://codeforces.com/problemset) that you can solve online to practice, but there’s no online editor. Rather, you write your solution in your own editor and then upload it to their system which then tests your code against a suite of test cases.

They also frequently hold [contests](https://codeforces.com/contests) where the best competitive programmers take part in.

### Great for

Advanced and competitive programmers who truly enjoy solving difficult algorithm challenges.

### Pricing / Premium content

All the challenges on Codeforces are free, there is no premium pricing option.
