LeetCode has a collection of some of the best algorithm challenges online today. The topics they cover require knowledge of data structures such as binary trees, heaps, linked lists, etc., which is why their challenges are a bit more advanced than some other websites — but the challenges are great if used when preparing for a software engineering interview.

They also have a [Mock Interview](https://leetcode.com/mockinterview/) section that is specifically for job interview preparation, they host their own coding [contests](https://leetcode.com/contest/), and they have a section for [articles](https://leetcode.com/articles/pour-water/) to help you better understand certain problems.

LeetCode has a collection of some of the best algorithm challenges online today. The topics they cover require knowledge of data structures such as binary trees, heaps, linked lists, and so on, which is why their challenges are a bit more advanced than some other websites. But the challenges are great if used to prepare for a software engineering interview.

They also have a [Mock Interview](https://leetcode.com/interview/) section that is specifically for job interview preparation. They also host their own [coding contests](https://leetcode.com/contest/), and they have a great [discussion board](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question?currentPage=1&orderBy=hot&query=) where people talk about interview questions, jobs, compensation, and other topics related to engineering.

### Great for

LeetCode is great for intermediate-to-advanced programmers. It might not be the best suited for brand new coders who don’t know how to write basic loops yet, but once you learn the fundamentals this is a great site to practice coding.

### Pricing / Premium content

There are free challenges available on LeetCode, and they also have a [premium](https://leetcode.com/subscribe/) subscription which gets you access to more challenges and other features of the platform.
