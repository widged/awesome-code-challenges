GeeksforGeeks has the [best collection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/) of articles, explanations, and code solutions for algorithms and data structure topics. You can see an [example here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shortest-common-supersequence/) of how they break down a complex question into simpler parts, explain the solution and then provide a code solution. They also have an online [editor](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/rotate-a-linked-list/1) where you can practice solving challenges yourself before seeing the solution.

If you are preparing for a software engineering interview, you should definitely use this website to prepare and brush up on the harder algorithm questions.
