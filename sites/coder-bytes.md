### Great for

Coderbyte is perfect for people in the beginner-to-intermediate phase of their careers who are preparing for interviews. There is a library of harder challenges as well for those who like to solve coding problems for fun, but this isn’t primarily a site for competitive programmers.

### Pricing / Premium content

There are a handful of free challenges on Coderbyte, and then there are hundreds of premium challenges and over 1 million user solutions that are available to [members](https://coderbyte.com/member).

Coderbyte provides 200+ coding challenges you can solve directly online in one of 10 programming languages (check out this [example](https://www.coderbyte.com/information/First%20Factorial)). The challenges range from easy (finding the largest word in a string) to hard (print the maximum cardinality matching of a graph).

They also provide a collection of [algorithm tutorials](https://www.coderbyte.com/algorithm/tree-traversal-algorithms), introductory videos, and [interview preparation courses](https://www.coderbyte.com/course/google-interview-questions). Unlike HackerRank and other similar websites, you are able to view the solutions other users provide for any challenge aside from the _official_ solutions posted by Coderbyte.
